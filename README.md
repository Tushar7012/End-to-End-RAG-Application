#  End-to-End RAG Application

A complete **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** system that combines document retrieval with generative AI to answer questions based on internal knowledge sources—in a single unified pipeline.

---

##  About

This project demonstrates the full lifecycle of a RAG system:
- Retrieves relevant information from your own document corpus.
- Generates accurate, context-aware answers using a language model.
- Seamlessly integrates retrieval and generation for enhanced knowledge-based responses.

Ideal for building AI-powered Q&A systems, knowledge plugins, or intelligent assistants.

##  Core Components

- **Retrieval Pipeline**: Handles indexing and querying of internal or external documents.
- **Generation Pipeline**: Leverages an LLM to craft responses based on retrieved content.
- **End-to-End System**: Binds both steps into a smooth workflow—document retrieval → prompt construction → AI generation → answer delivery.
  
##  Getting Started

1. **Clone the repo**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Tushar7012/End-to-End-RAG-Application.git
    cd End-to-End-RAG-Application
    ```

2. **Install dependencies**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. **Run the application**
    ```bash
    python app.py
    ```

4. **Interact**
   - Access the UI or API endpoint for querying and testing the RAG system.

##  Use Cases

- Knowledge-based Q&A systems for enterprise or internal documentation.
- Intelligent assistants powered by proprietary or domain-specific data.
- Academic or experimentation pipelines for RAG research and prototyping.
