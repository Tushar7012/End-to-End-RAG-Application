#  End-to-End RAG Application

A complete **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** system that combines document retrieval with generative AI to answer questions based on internal knowledge sourcesâ€”in a single unified pipeline.

---

##  About

This project demonstrates the full lifecycle of a RAG system:
- Retrieves relevant information from your own document corpus.
- Generates accurate, context-aware answers using a language model.
- Seamlessly integrates retrieval and generation for enhanced knowledge-based responses.

Ideal for building AI-powered Q&A systems, knowledge plugins, or intelligent assistants.

##  Core Components

- **Retrieval Pipeline**: Handles indexing and querying of internal or external documents.
- **Generation Pipeline**: Leverages an LLM to craft responses based on retrieved content.
- **End-to-End System**: Binds both steps into a smooth workflowâ€”document retrieval â†’ prompt construction â†’ AI generation â†’ answer delivery.
