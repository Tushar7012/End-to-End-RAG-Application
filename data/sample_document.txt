# Sample Document for RAG Application Testing

## Introduction to RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)

RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) is a technique that combines the power of information retrieval with text generation to create more accurate and contextual responses. It works by first retrieving relevant documents from a knowledge base and then using those documents as context for generating answers.

## How RAG Works

1. **Query Processing**: When a user asks a question, it is first converted into a vector embedding.

2. **Document Retrieval**: The query embedding is used to search a vector database (like Pinecone) to find the most relevant documents.

3. **Context Building**: The retrieved documents are combined with the original question to form a prompt.

4. **Answer Generation**: A Large Language Model (LLM) generates an answer based on the provided context and question.

## Benefits of RAG

- **Reduced Hallucinations**: By grounding the LLM's responses in actual documents, RAG reduces the likelihood of generating false information.

- **Up-to-date Information**: Unlike static LLMs trained on fixed datasets, RAG can access the latest information from your document store.

- **Domain Specificity**: RAG allows you to create specialized AI assistants that have deep knowledge of your specific domain.

- **Source Attribution**: You can trace answers back to their source documents, improving transparency and trust.

## Components Used in This Application

### Haystack AI
Haystack is an open-source framework for building production-ready LLM applications, RAG pipelines, and state-of-the-art search systems.

### Pinecone
Pinecone is a vector database that stores and indexes high-dimensional vectors for fast similarity searches.

### FastAPI
FastAPI is a modern, high-performance web framework for building APIs with Python.

### OpenAI
OpenAI's GPT models are used as the language model for generating responses based on the retrieved context.

## Getting Started

1. Set up your API keys in the `.env` file
2. Ingest your documents using the ingestion pipeline
3. Start the FastAPI server
4. Ask questions through the web interface

The system will retrieve relevant documents from your knowledge base and generate accurate, context-aware responses.
